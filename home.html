                    <p>Safety training provides individuals with the knowledge and skills to manage a crisis
                        safely. These include the knowledge of planning for a fire and fire drills, beginner
                        first aid, and reacting in a crisis. For corporate organizations, the value of this
                        training lies not only with the knowledge and skills it provides to employees to manage
                        a crisis, but in the damage control that comes as a result of this knowledge. For
                        families, this knowledge is priceless. Your children and loved ones are your
                        responsibility, and you need to be well trained to react in the safest manner in the
                        case of an emergency.

                            ACA provides residents with the necessary training to reacting to a crisis. Field experts

                            will offer training.

                            At ACA we believe that it is essential for children, teachers, and school staff to be well
                            informed on safety procedures and managing emergencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As part of this training, a risk assessment is performed in the educational institution to
                            ensure the area is well equipped and has safety exits. Accordingly, a safety plan will be
                            designed and delivered to teachers and students on how to react and behave in the case of an
                            emergency.

                            at-home safety, fire planning, basic first aid, and crisis reaction.
